How to Compile and Run the Program : financial_sentiment

The program relies on two inputs :
     1. A data file titled 'data4' which is used to train a sentiment model.
     2. A tweet from the user which is passed when running the program.
 
 'data4' needs to be in the same directory as the program.
  To run the program with a tweet use th following command :
          python financial_sentiment "<tweet text>"
          
  where <tweet text> is a tweet about any financial company.
  
  The program will return the tweet sentiment, a sentiment of our model, where 0 means negative sentiment and 1 means a postive sentiment, 
                   sentiment from textBlob an off-the-shelf sentiment analysis model.
  For the TextBlob Sentiment Analysis, the one with the higher sentiment represents the sentiment for the tweet.
